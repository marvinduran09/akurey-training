Use this Figma project to obtain the site assets and guidelines.
Just develop the HOME page.
Please check the Components and Styles pages.
The site must be responsive, and the development process must be mobile-first. It means you must create the mobile, tablet and website versions of the home page.
The assets can be found in GDrive / AKUREY / Trainings / Tech / Web / 2. Self-Control / One Piece Website / svg.
SASS must be used as a styling pre-processor.
Icons such as hamburger menus and magnifying glasses must come from an icon font. IconMoon, Fontastic or Material Design can be used for font generation.
Use Atomic Design to create the components.
You can use Bootstrap to handle the design layout between devices. flexbox can be used to reduce development time.
The site must be functional for Chrome and Firefox, and the presentation of the elements must be identical on all browsers.
Use gulp or any other task manager to locally run the project.
The project must be “Pixel Perfect”. It means colors, styles, design, and fonts cannot be changed.
The magic is in the details: pay special attention to them. For example:
Mobile, you have: -- a hamburger menu. -- a full-width hero image. -- a defined left & right margin for the content. -- …
Tablet: -- the Synopsis box has a different position. -- …
Desktop, you have -- top menu -- hero image & synopsis boxes have a different layout -- …
At this point you don’t have to worry about the JS behaviors, like:
“Search” functionality.
Switch Language functionality.
You must develop the hamburger menu (mobile & tablet) behavior.
You must develop the Synopsis’ “Read All” button functionality.
This are the URLs of the menu anchors:
Home: / -Characters: /characters
Islands: /islands
Mist Objects: /mist-objects
The “See all” anchors drive to the page following the structure of the previous point.
